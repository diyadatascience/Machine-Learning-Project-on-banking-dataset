# Banking Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning

This repository contains the analysis and machine learning model development for a banking dataset. The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build and validate predictive models using the provided dataset.

### Contents
- **Banking Dataset.csv**: The dataset containing banking-related data for analysis and model building.
- **ML_Banking_dataset.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that includes the code for data exploration, preprocessing, and machine learning model development. This notebook covers data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the banking dataset to understand the underlying patterns and build machine learning models to predict certain outcomes. The notebook walks through the process of loading the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, preprocessing the data, building predictive models, and evaluating their performance.

### Detailed Description

#### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- **Loading the Data**: The dataset is loaded from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the distribution and relationships of the variables in the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

#### 2. Machine Learning Model Development
- **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task.
- **Training and Validation**: Splitting the data into training and validation sets, training the models, and validating their performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to achieve the best performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the models using various metrics to determine their accuracy and robustness.

### Code Overview
The Jupyter notebook, ML_Banking_dataset.ipynb, is structured to guide you through the entire process of data analysis and machine learning model development. It begins with importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) section includes visualizations and summary statistics to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. Following EDA, the notebook details the data cleaning process, addressing missing values and outliers. Feature engineering steps are applied to enhance the dataset. Various machine learning models are then selected, trained, and evaluated, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The notebook also includes hyperparameter tuning using grid search to optimize model performance. Finally, the models' results are compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness.
